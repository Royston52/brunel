# Ore Generation

Ore generation in Brunel occurs by veins of mixed materials which closely match those described in the Engineer's
Manuel under Mineral Deposits. The amount of a given vein available in a certain location is determined by both its
biome type and depth category:

  * deep (0–32)
  * buried (32–64)
  * surface (64–128)
  * mountain (128+)

Within each region, the frequency and size of a given deposit may vary considerably. Some veins may even be completely
absent for certain regions. Here's a rough guide of what to expect:

## Deep

At this depth, ore generation is pretty homogeneous across all biomes. All veins appear, in decreasing order of
frequency:

  * 7 x Coal
  * 7 x Iron
  * 6 x Apatite
  * 5 x Bauxite
  * 5 x Copper
  * 4 x Magnetite
  * 4 x Lead
  * 3 x Nickel
  * 3 x Galena
  * 2 x Lapis
  * 2 x Silver
  * 1 x Gold
  * 1 x Uranium

## Buried

  * 6 x Coal
  * 6 x Iron
  * 5 x Apatite
  * 4 x Bauxite
  * 4 x Copper
  * 3 x Magnetite
  * 3 x Lead
  * 2 x Nickel
  * 2 x Galena
  * 1 x Lapis

## Surface

  * 8 x Coal
  * 8 x Iron
  * 6 x Apatite
  * 4 x Bauxite
  * 4 x Copper
  * 2 x Lead

## Mountain

  * 8 x Coal
  * 8 x Iron
  * 4 x Bauxite
  * 2 x Lead
