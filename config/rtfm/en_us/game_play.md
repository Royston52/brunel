# Hunger

Hunger has been altered by [Spice of Life](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/the-spice-of-life)
so that eating the same foods repeatedly
will replenish less and less of your food
bar. Check out the [farming](farming.md) section for
ideas on how to cope, but you'll find you
want to make yourself a lunch bag as soon
as you can:

# Thirst

With [Tough as Nails](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tough-as-nails) your character can
die of thirst (almost). To start out, you
can drink by right-clicking on any body
of water, but this won't get you very
far. Take a look at making a canteen as
soon as possible!

# Exposure

The [Tough as Nails](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tough-as-nails) mod also makes it
so that you can (really) die of exposure:
either by being too hot or too cold. Your
HUD now has a globe in the center which
shows your body temperature. Collect some
wool for a nice warm suit:

# Healing

Healing in Brunel works very much like in
the real world: with rest and medical
attention. The [First Aid](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/first-aid) mod disables
regeneration, and adds various ways to
heal yourself. Try some bandages if you
get hurt!
