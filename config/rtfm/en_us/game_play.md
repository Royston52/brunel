# Hunger

Hunger has been altered by [Spice of Life](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/the-spice-of-life)
so that eating the same foods repeatedly
will replenish less and less of your food
bar. Check out the [farming](farming.md) section for
ideas on how to cope, but you'll find you
want to make yourself a lunch bag as soon
as you can:

# Thirst

With [Tough as Nails](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tough-as-nails) your character can
die of thirst (almost). To start out, you
can drink by right-clicking on any body
of water, but this won't get you very
far. Take a look at making a canteen as
soon as possible!

# Exposure

The [Tough as Nails](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tough-as-nails) mod also makes it
so that you can (really) die of exposure:
either by being too hot or too cold. Your
HUD now has a globe in the center which
shows your body temperature. Collect some
wool for a nice warm suit:

# Healing

Healing in Brunel works very much like in
the real world: with rest and medical
attention. The [First Aid](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/first-aid) mod disables
regeneration, and adds various ways to
heal yourself. Try some bandages if you
get hurt!

# Dying

If you do die, then the [Gravestone](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/gravestone-mod) mod
will plant a headstone just above where
you died. By breaking the headstone, you
can get back all the arms, armor, and
loot you had with you at the time.

# Light

Unlike in vanilla Minecraft, the dark
places of Brunel are truely dark. You'll
experience pitch black caves, and some
truely dark nights during a new moon. On
the other hand, a full moon casts quite a
bit of light!

# Mob Spawning

Dangerous creatures only spawn in the
absolute blackness of underground caves
in the overworld. All bets are off if you
jump through any portals, though...

# Sleeping

Sleeping works mostly the same as with
vanilla Minecraft, except that any one
player sleeping is enough to trigger the
whole server to sleep. If you don't want
to reset your spawn location at the same
time, check out the sleeping bag.
