# Biomes

Brunel uses Biomes o'Plenty for its
primary world generation: including both
the selection of biomes and their
placement around the world. As you
travel north and south, you should
expect to find wide (3kmâ€“5km) bands of
hotter and cooler climates. Within a
given band, traveling east and west will
let you locate wetter and dryer climates
(with no particular pattern). The
modpack offers the full section of
Biomes o'Plenty biomes, so, for full
details, check out their
[wiki](http://biomesoplenty.wikia.com).
