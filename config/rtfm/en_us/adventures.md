## Mob Spawning

Mob spawning has been altered in Brunel
so that most mobs only spawn in absolute
darkness, and only underground. Don't
get complacent, though... there are still
a few which spawn above ground, and even
the underground sort will brave the world
above to come hunt...

## Biomes

Brunel uses [Biomes o'Plenty](http://biomesoplenty.wikia.com) for its
primary world generation: including both
the selection of biomes and their
placement around the world. As you
travel north and south, you should
expect to find wide (3kmâ€“5km) bands of
hotter and cooler climates. Within a
given band, traveling east and west will
let you locate wetter and dryer climates
(with no particular pattern).

## Seasons

As you spend more time in Brunel, you'll
notice the effects of [Serene Seasons](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/serene-seasons) as
summer gives way to fall, and winter
after that.

## The Nether

With [NetherEx](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/netherex), you'll find that the
underworld has been transformed from an
endless sea of lava and netherrack to a
rich (but dangerous!) world of its own.

## Twilight Forest

If you need a break from steam and steel,
Twilight Forest is a magical dimension
filled with beautiful, peaceful forests;
deadly monsters; magical creatures, and
fantastic treasures, the likes of which
can't be found in the mundane world.
